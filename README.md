# Hello!

Typescripted React app, with some MUI-components, that allows you to create and toggle todo's.

They are synced with a Realtime Database on my Google Firebase, so we are all sharing the same database for now.


What Firebase connectivity allows, among other things, is to add authentication, hosting and of course the update/delete functionality pretty easily.
